# The one where Chandler gets work done

In the TV show Friends, a running joke is that nobody knows what Chandler Bing really does for work. And in a trivia contest with the iconic apartment at stake, Rachel and Monica lose said apartment to Joey and Chandler because Rachel and Monica could not guess what Chandler's job was. 

    Rachel: "ohh it has something to do with numbers"
    Monica: "uhh processing!"
    Rachel: "he carries around a briefcase..."
    Monica: "ohhhh it has something to do with transponding..."
    Rachel: "OH OH OH HE'S A TRANSPONST... OH HE'S A **TRANSPONSTER**!"
    Everyone: ...
    Monica: "THAT'S NOT EVEN A WORD."

## Work work work

So in this mini kata, you'll do some transponstering. And along the way you'll practice some techniques for getting a troublesome class into a test harness.

There are five small exercises in this kata:

    a. handling an irritating parameter
    b. uncovering a hidden dependency
    c. untangling a construction blob
    d. breaking a global dependency
    e. peeling back an onion parameter


Each exercise lives in its own subdirectory. The goal is to instantiate the Transponster class in the test class and see if you can get coverage. 

The exercises are relatively cumulative, so if you're up to the challenge (_Chandler would_), you can go straight to the last exercise.
